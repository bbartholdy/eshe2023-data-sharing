Q45,"The goal of this survey is to understand general attitudes and habits surrounding data archiving and sharing across different biological fields. 

 

The target demographic for this survey is researchers as well as other individuals that could be considered either scientific data producers or consumers of data for scientific activities.  We are also interested in understanding to what degree the potential benefit for broader impacts and outreach motivates (or could motivate) data sharing.

 
This survey is anonymous and will be used in a descriptive publication that we hope will help journals, funding agencies, and scholarly professional societies in their efforts improve their support and incentives for ethical data transparency and accessibility."

Q32,Professional incentives for data sharing are increasing and will fuel more ubiquitous and meaningful data sharing as time goes on
Q33,Better data sharing/transparency will help to democratize the ability of all scientists to contribute to scientific advances
Q34,Better data sharing/transparency will help advance scientific knowledge more rapidly and efficiently than would otherwise be possible
Q35,"Stricter policies for data sharing must be enforced at all scholarly institutions, from journals to professional societies to universities to funding agencies."
Q42,"Journals and funding agencies should adopt stricter criteria that authors and researchers must meet to gain exceptions to data sharing requirements.(For instance, providing a letter from a museum stating that measurements/imagery cannot be archived or shared.)"
Q36,"The concerns of all stakeholders (first authors, collaborators, thesis advisors, museums, descendant populations) about sharing a given dataset should be considered and respected."
Q37,There needs to be more flexibility in data sharing requirements by open access journals due to ethical considerations of some datasets.
Q38,The push for open access sharing of data is too strong and may lead to wide scale misuse of shared data.
Q39,It is important to archive data using professional platforms even when there are restrictions on sharing in order to allow future verification of a study’s results.
Q40,There are online repositories that allow data archiving without overly strict requirements for subsequent data sharing.
Q41,"When appropriate repositories are available, all individuals should archive their data in potentially accessible ways regardless of career stage."
