## Key takeaway

Many of the perceived negatives of data sharing can be solved by implementing FAIR
principles when sharing/publishing data.

Overall, the outcome of the survey suggests that the positives of sharing data
outweigh negatives.

## Data source

The data used in this analysis was generated in another study by Mulligan and
colleagues [-@mulliganDataSharing2022] and made available under a CC0 license.
It was downloaded directly from the public repository (DRYAD): https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5x69p8d40

```{r}
#| label: download-data
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: show
read_csv("https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1034350")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-survey-questions
#| tbl-cap: "Questions asked in the survey."
survey_questions |>
  filter(number != "Q45", 
         number != "Q1",
         str_detect(number, "TEXT", negate = T)) |> # remove consent questions
  knitr::kable()
```

## Data sharing

Data sharing, archiving, and publishing are terms that are often used interchangeably,
but they describe three distinct practices. We consider sharing to be
the transfer of data between researchers, e.g. collaborators. Archiving is storing
the data in a trusted long-term storage location after a project is completed.
Publishing is making the data available on a trusted repository. In the survey,
these were not distinguished, so for the analysis, we we will also use them
interchangeably.

`r (122 / (122 + 29)) * 100`% of respondents benefited from others sharing data
with them.

> `r survey_questions$number[15]`: `r survey_questions$question[15]`

```{r}
#| label: tbl-benefit-from
#| tbl-cap: "Answers to the question 'Have you benefited from other researchers sharing their data? (single choice)"

## FAIR data principles

<!-- Image: https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/ -->
![The Turing Way Community. This illustration is created by Scriberia with The Turing Way community, used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807](img/FAIRPrinciples.jpg)

FAIR $\neq$ Open

The FAIR principles were developed as guiding principles for resonsible research
data management and stewardship, and are not synonymous with the data being open.

- F = Findable
- A = Accessible
- I = Interoperable
- R = Reusable

Can the data be found and is their findability ensured for the future? This
involves a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI) and searchable metadata (F).
Can the data be accessed via open, standardised protocols (A)?
Can another researcher in a similar field incorporate the data into their workflow,
and will they understand the format and terminology? Can they even open the file
without purchasing software (I)? Is it clear how the data are meant and allowed
to be re-used? Data should be accompanied by detailed documentation and a
license (R).

### Prevent data loss

If data are stored/archived on institutional accounts or, worse, personal computers,
there is an increased risk of data loss. Even if the data can be located,
if the researcher who collected and analysed the data is no longer accessible,
and the data and methodology were poorly documented, this may also result in data
loss..

## Repositories

`r (87 / (60 + 87)) * 100`% of respondents have previously published data in a repository.

```{r}
repos <- paleoanth_long |>
  filter(question == "Q15")
```

> `r survey_questions$number[23]`: `r survey_questions$question[23]`

```{r}
#| label: tbl-repo
#| tbl-cap: "Answers to the question 'Have you archived and/or shared data using an online repository before?' (single choice)"

paleoanth_long |>
  filter(question == "Q14") |>
  count(response) |>
  knitr::kable()
```


> `r survey_questions$number[24]`: `r survey_questions$question[24]`

The top repositories include MorphoSource, DRYAD, Zenodo, and journal supplementary
materials (@fig-top-repositories).

```{r}
#| label: fig-top-repositories
repos |>
  separate_longer_delim(response, delim = ";") |>
  count(response) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice_head(n = 8) |>

  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(response, -n), y = n, fill = response)) +
    geom_col() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme_get() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

> `r survey_questions$number[18]`: `r survey_questions$question[18]`

```{r}
#| label: tbl-data-access
#| tbl-cap: "How respondents have obtained access to shared data. Multiple choices were allowed."

```

::: {.callout-warning}
The biggest problem with sending data to other researchers---by, for
example, email---is that there are often no (clear) terms of re-use (e.g. a license).
:::

### Trusted/certified repositories

Things to look for in a trusted repository:

- certification (e.g. CoreTrustSeal)
- must assign a persistent identifier (PID)
- uses an appropriate metadata scheme
- provides appropriate license options (e.g. creative commons)
- [OPTIONAL] access restriction options

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Good**

- Zenodo
- DRYAD
- The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR)*
- NCBI/ENA (no persistent identifiers)
- Protein data bank (e.g. UniProt)
- IsoArcH
- MorphoSource

:::
::: {.column}
**Bad**

- GitHub**
- Academia.edu
- ResearchGate
- Personal/lab website
- Journal supplementary material (as PDF)

:::
::::

For a more complete overview, see [re3data](https://re3data.org).


[*CoreTrustSeal certified]{.aside}

[**A GitHub repository can often be linked to a trusted repository to create a persistent identifier and a snapshot of the repository that can be archived and published.]{.aside}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip

The items on the **Bad** list can of course be used in conjunction with a trusted
repository to ensure maximum impact.
:::

### Access options

Being accessible is not synonymous with being open. It just means that there
are clear policies on access to the data. 'Available upon (reasonable) request'
is not a clear policy on access. Most certified repositories provide the following
access options:

- Open
- Embargo
- Restricted
- Metadata-only

> 'Data available upon (reasonable) request'

![GIPHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/8vyZouWSVhslwWA7Lp/giphy.gif)

What exactly is a 'reasonable' request. How is it available? Who do I contact?
In a recent study on data sharing, the most common reason for declining a
request was found to be that,
either the corresponding author had no time to look for the data, or the data were
lost [@tedersooDataSharing2021]. Other obstacles include
broken e-mails [@vinesAvailabilityResearch2014]. Often, institutional emails are
used, but these are deactivated if a researcher leaves the institution.


## Experiences

Raw number of neutral experiences, (respondent that they had no negative experiences
from sharing data): `r sum(paleoanth_responses$Q19 == "no", na.rm = T)`

Raw number of negative experiences: `r sum(paleoanth_responses$Q19 == "yes", na.rm = T)`

Raw number of benefits: `r sum(paleoanth_responses$Q18 != "other (write in)", na.rm = T)`

ggsave("figures/poster_benefits-negatives.png", height = 24, width = 48, units = "in")
```

Overall there are more often positive experiences associated with data sharing
than negative experiences. More people have never had a bad experience (@fig-negative).
More people believe they will experience career benefits (@fig-career-benefit).
And fewer people presented a bad experience from data sharing (@fig-experiences).

### Why share?

There are many reasons to share the data that benefit both the researcher and
society. Additionally, the data and methodology are needed to validate a
study.

> An independent researcher was able to confirm and build upon results of my study because I shared the data.

This is science working the way science was intended to work. This is also true
when subsequent studies are unable to confirm preceding studies.

Problem: People used the data without acknowledging/citing me or other sources.  
Solution: Published on a repository with a license.

Problem: People mis-used and/or mis-represented my data.  
Solution: Published on a repository with proper documentation.

Problem: My research was scooped.  
Solution: Published on a repository with a license and embargo (depending on the situation)

Problem: My student's research was scooped.  
Solution: See above.

Problem: People criticized me for perceived errors.  
Solution: The benefit of having many eyes on all aspects of your analysis is the
increased ability to spot mistakes. It often feels uncomfortable in this situation,
but as scientists we need to get over this feeling.

Problem: Another stakeholder became angry with me.  
Solution: Always be in continuous communication with stakeholders, and respect
their wishes regarding research outputs.

There are of course other ways of being 'scooped' where the FAIR principles
may not help. This is part of a much-needed culture change in academia to
incentivise collaboration over competition, quality of research outputs over
quantity (putting an end to 'publish or perish'), and Knowledge accumulation built on
rigorous, validated science rather than a flimsy Jenga tower of unreplicated and
non-reproducible results.
